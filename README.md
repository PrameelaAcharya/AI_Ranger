The proposed system introduces an AI-powered autonomous ground robot for real-time wildlife protection and human-wildlife conflict prevention. Built upon the NEWRRO Arjuna platform, this robot integrates LIDAR, thermal imaging, AI-based object detection, and IoT systems to monitor wildlife health, detect illegal activities, predict forest hazards, and notify authorities. This solution aims to reduce poaching, deforestation, and animal-human conflicts through continuous surveillance and intelligent decision-making.
